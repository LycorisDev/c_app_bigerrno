THE "_" ENV VAR

- The "_" var is initialized to the input used to call the shell or script 
(argv[0]). Keep this value for `$0`, and remove the var from the env list to 
store it in the intern list.
- It doesn't show in the export list, because it belongs to the intern var 
list. Don't ever export it.
- It is updated to the last arg of the most recent simple command (= no pipe).
- Within a pipeline, it is added to the env list and is set to the relative 
path of the command (the future argv[0] of this command).

THE "SHLVL" ENV VAR

- If the var doesn't exist when opening bigerrno or before calling execve, 
initialize it to 0.
- Then, increment it when opening bigerrno.
- In the child process, decrement it unless the command is a shell.
